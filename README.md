# Artificial-Intelligence-101
Artificial intelligence (AI) is the ability of a machine or computer system to perform tasks that would normally require human intelligence, 
such as learning, problem-solving, and decision-making.

There are three main categories of AI: 

- **Narrow or weak AI :** Narrow or weak AI is designed to perform a specific task or set of tasks, such as recognizing speech or playing chess. 
These systems are trained to perform a specific task using a large dataset and are not able to perform other tasks outside their scope of training.

- **General or strong AI :**
General or strong AI, on the other hand, is designed to be able to perform any intellectual task that a human being can. 
These systems are able to learn and adapt to new situations, and are often used for tasks that require a high level of decision-making or problem-solving.

- **Superintelligent AI :**
Superintelligent AI refers to systems that are significantly more intelligent than the best human minds in almost every field, 
including scientific creativity, general wisdom, and social skills. It is not clear when, or if, superintelligent AI will be developed, 
as it would require significant advances in the field of AI.

**1- Structure of artificial intelligence (AI) :**
In terms of structure, AI systems can be broadly classified into two categories: 

- **Symbolic AI :** Symbolic AI systems use logic and rules to solve problems.
- **Machine learning :** Machine learning systems use statistical methods and patterns in data to make decisions. 

There are also hybrid AI systems that combine elements of both symbolic and machine learning approaches.

**2- Architecture of artificial intelligence (AI) :**
The architecture of artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the way that an AI system is designed and built. 
There are many different architectures that can be used to build AI systems, 
and the choice of architecture will depend on the specific requirements and goals of the system. 
Some common architectures used in AI include:

- **Rule-based systems :** These systems use a set of rules to make decisions or perform tasks. The rules are typically encoded in a logical or symbolic form, and the system follows the rules to solve problems or complete tasks.

- **Expert systems :** These are AI systems that are designed to mimic the decision-making abilities of a human expert in a particular field. They use a combination of rules and data to make decisions and provide recommendations.

- **Neural networks :** These are AI systems that are inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. They consist of layers of interconnected nodes or "neurons," which process and transmit information. Neural networks are particularly good at learning from data and can be used for tasks such as image and speech recognition.

- **Evolutionary algorithms :** These are AI systems that use principles of natural evolution, such as reproduction, mutation, and selection, to search for solutions to problems. They are often used in optimization tasks, where the goal is to find the best solution from a set of possible options.

- **Cognitive architectures :** These are AI systems that are designed to replicate the high-level cognitive functions of the human brain, such as reasoning, planning, and problem-solving. They typically consist of multiple modules or subsystems that perform different functions, and they can be used to build intelligent agents or virtual assistants.
